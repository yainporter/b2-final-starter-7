```
1. Merchant Coupons Index 

As a merchant
When I visit my merchant dashboard page
I see a link to view all of my coupons
When I click this link
I'm taken to my coupons index page
Where I see all of my coupon names including their amount off 
And each coupon's name is also a link to its show page.
```

```
2. Merchant Coupon Create 

As a merchant
When I visit my coupon index page 
I see a link to create a new coupon.
When I click that link 
I am taken to a new page where I see a form to add a new coupon.
When I fill in that form with a name, unique code, an amount, and whether that amount is a percent or a dollar amount
And click the Submit button
I'm taken back to the coupon index page 
And I can see my new coupon listed.


* Sad Paths to consider: 
1. This Merchant already has 5 active coupons
2. Coupon code entered is NOT unique
```

```
3. Merchant Coupon Show Page 

As a merchant 
When I visit a merchant's coupon show page 
I see that coupon's name and code 
And I see the percent/dollar off value
As well as its status (active or inactive)
And I see a count of how many times that coupon has been used.

(Note: "use" of a coupon should be limited to successful transactions.)
```

```
4. Merchant Coupon Deactivate

As a merchant 
When I visit one of my active coupon's show pages
I see a button to deactivate that coupon
When I click that button
I'm taken back to the coupon show page 
And I can see that its status is now listed as 'inactive'.

* Sad Paths to consider: 
1. A coupon cannot be deactivated if there are any pending invoices with that coupon.
```

```
5. Merchant Coupon Activate

As a merchant 
When I visit one of my inactive coupon show pages
I see a button to activate that coupon
When I click that button
I'm taken back to the coupon show page 
And I can see that its status is now listed as 'active'.
```

```
6. Merchant Coupon Index Sorted

As a merchant
When I visit my coupon index page
I can see that my coupons are separated between active and inactive coupons. 
```

```
7. Merchant Invoice Show Page: Subtotal and Grand Total Revenues

As a merchant
When I visit one of my merchant invoice show pages
I see the subtotal for my merchant from this invoice (that is, the total that does not include coupon discounts)
And I see the grand total revenue after the discount was applied
And I see the name and code of the coupon used as a link to that coupon's show page.
```

```
8. Admin Invoice Show Page: Subtotal and Grand Total Revenues

As an admin
When I visit one of my admin invoice show pages
I see the name and code of the coupon that was used (if there was a coupon applied)
And I see both the subtotal revenue from that invoice (before coupon) and the grand total revenue (after coupon) for this invoice.

* Alternate Paths to consider: 
1. There may be invoices with items from more than 1 merchant. Coupons for a merchant only apply to items from that merchant.
2. When a coupon with a dollar-off value is used with an invoice with multiple merchants' items, the dollar-off amount applies to the total amount even though there may be items present from another merchant.
